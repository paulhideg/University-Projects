You are the mighty hammurabi, elected to office for a five year term as ruler of Summeria. 
Each year, you must decide your capital city's land management policy, make sure that your people do not starve,
and plant next year's crops. The currency is represented by units of grain. The game lasts for 5 turns. Each turn is 1 year.

Each year, yoour trusted advisor reports the current situation, in the format at the bottom of the page.
Use the data from Year 1 below when starting the game.

Each year, you decide how many acres of land to buy or sell, 
how many units of grain to feed your population with,
and how many acres of land are planted with grain.
You cannot buy more land than you have grain for, you cannot sell more land than you have, 
you cannot feed people with grain you don't have, you cannot plant more acres than you have,
you cannot plant grain you do not have.

The next steps happen without your intervention:
3. Land is bought or sold at the given price, and the stock of grain is updated.
Each year, land prices vary between 15 and 25 grain per acre (random).

4. Grain used to feed the population is subtracted from the stock. Each person needs 20 units of grain to survive.
People who do not receive this amount starve.
If half your population starves during the year, the game is over.
If no one starved, between 0 and 10 people (random) come to the city.

5. Grain is harvested. Each person can harvest at most 10 acres. Each year, the harvest is random between 1 and 6
units of grain per acre.

6.  Each year, there is a 20% chance of a rat infestation. Rats eat at most 10% of stored grain.

When the 5 years are up:
7. The game ends. If you have over 100 population and over 1000 acres, display a congratulation message.
Otherwise display a loss message.
